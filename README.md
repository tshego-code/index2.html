# Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript

**Author:** Tshegofatso Moloto  
**Course:** Software Engineering  
**Assignment:** Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **JavaScript** to make web pages interactive, engaging, and user-friendly.  
It includes **event handling**, **dynamic DOM manipulation**, and **custom form validation** — all written in one clean and well-commented file.  

The project is designed to showcase creativity, technical skills, and practical use of JavaScript.

## 🎯 Features

1. **🌙 Dark/Light Mode Toggle**
   - Switch between light and dark themes with one click.
   - Uses event listeners and CSS class toggling.

2. **🎮 Counter Game**
   - A button that increments a counter every time it’s clicked.
   - Demonstrates simple DOM updates and event handling.

3. **📖 FAQ Section**
   - Collapsible FAQ answers that expand and collapse when clicked.
   - Uses DOM traversal (`nextElementSibling`) and toggle logic.

4. **📋 Sign-Up Form with Validation**
   - Form with **Name, Email, Password** fields.
   - Validates input using conditions and regular expressions.
   - Provides user-friendly error messages.
   - Prevents incorrect submissions and displays success feedback.

## 🗂️ Files

- **index.html** → Contains HTML structure, embedded CSS, and JavaScript code (all in one file for simplicity).
- **README.md** → Documentation of the project.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → Page structure and content.  
- **CSS3** → Styling for light/dark modes, forms, buttons, and layout.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** → Event handling, interactivity, and validation logic.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I practiced and demonstrated:
- Attaching **event listeners** to elements (buttons, inputs, form).
- Using **DOM manipulation** to update page content dynamically.
- Creating at least **two interactive features** (counter, dark mode, FAQ).
- Writing a **custom form validation system** with regex and conditions.
- Structuring clear, modular, and well-commented code.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Try out the features:
   - Toggle between **dark and light mode**.
   - Play with the **counter game**.
   - Click questions in the **FAQ section**.
   - Test the **sign-up form** (try entering invalid details to see validation in action).
